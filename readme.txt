This is a Java project created with Apache Maven as a tool in VSCode, so I've included the whole project folder to run the program. 
The .java source code files and the .g4 file are located in the folder "main/java/ag223pi/dv507/a4, and then the OFP files are located one more folder called "example_programs". 
Path to files can be changed in launch.json inside .vscode folder.
